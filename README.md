## Git vs. GitHub
**Git** runs in the command line and manages your code through **_version control_**. Think of each version of your code as a checkpoint in Mario Kart. Each time you  commit changes in your code, it is like passing a "checkpoint", where you can revert back to that place. Git lives in your **_local directory_**, which is where you are actually coding and can be directly on your computer or in a program called **_cloud9_**. Cloud9 is a place where you can code in a language of your choice and your projects will live in a cloud. However, we will still consider this a local directory for our purposes.

**Github** stores code in the cloud. It is a website that visually tracks changes and we use it to send code from our local machine to github
