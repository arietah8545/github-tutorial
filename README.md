## Git vs. GitHub
#### Git runs in the command line.
* It manages your code through **_version control_**. Think of each version of your code as a checkpoint  
  in Mario Kart.
    * Each time you commit changes in your code, it is like passing a "checkpoint"
    * You can revert back to that version later
* Git lives in your **_local directory_**
    * This is where you are actually coding and can be directly on your computer or in a program  
      called cloud9
* **_Cloud9_** is a place where you can code in a language of your choice and your projects will live  
  in a cloud  
    * We consider this our local directory
* Git does **NOT** need github to run

#### Github is a website where code is stored. 
* Code is stored in the cloud
* It visually tracks changes
* Code is sent from our local machine to github
* Github **NEED** git to run
